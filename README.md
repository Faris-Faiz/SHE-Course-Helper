Background:
------
Universiti Malaya course registrations are coming up, and students are required to refer to either [this pdf file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16s4YsshokSlLWOz3WKGuY7s1jbLRY9ot/view?usp=sharing) or [the CiTra website](https://citra.um.edu.my/external-elective-courses) to figure out which SHE courses to take, and from which cluster. Me and Faiqah did the impossible whereby we manually scraped the data from MAYA and CiTra to figure out which courses are already full, and some only have 5 students as their quota, which is outrageous. Plenty of people only knew that their desired SHE course is full only on the day of registration. I myself like to make some preparations prior to registering my courses, hence I made this to reduce our headaches. One problem, it's not an automatic web scraper so this will only work as of right now. My high school friend Nazameerul is helping in making that as I'm kind of a noob in that department lol. Thanks for reading this far! :D
